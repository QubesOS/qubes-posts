             ---===[ Qubes Security Bulletin 094 ]===---

                             2023-09-27

            x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.6-2

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.17.2-2

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.

Summary
--------

On 2023-09-25, the Xen Project published XSA-439, "x86/AMD: Divide
speculative information leak" [3]:

| In the Zen1 microarchitecture, there is one divider in the
| pipeline which services uops from both threads.  In the case of #DE,
| the latched result from the previous DIV to execute will be forwarded
| speculatively.
|
| This is a covert channel that allows two threads to communicate
| without any system calls.  In also allows userspace to obtain the
| result of the most recent DIV instruction executed (even
| speculatively) in the core, which can be from a higher privilege
| context.

For more information, see:
 * https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7007.html

Impact
-------

On systems with an AMD Zen (first generation) CPU, an attacker who
compromises a VM can attempt to exploit this vulnerability in order to
infer the contents of data from a different execution context on the
same CPU core. This includes data belonging to a different VM (which
could be dom0) that was previously scheduled on that CPU core and Xen
itself. The latter is relevant because some system operations require
Xen to load data from a VM. This data may or may not be sensitive.
However, the attacker has no control over the data that Xen loads (and,
to some extent, no knowledge of what was loaded).

## What is the purpose of this announcement?

The purpose of this announcement is to inform the Qubes community that a new Qubes security bulletin (QSB) has been published.

## What is a Qubes security bulletin (QSB)?

A Qubes security bulletin (QSB) is a security announcement issued by the [Qubes security team](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/security.html#qubes-security-team). A QSB typically provides a summary and impact analysis of one or more recently-discovered software vulnerabilities, including details about patching to address them. A list of all QSBs is available [here](/security/qsb/).

## Why should I care about QSBs?

QSBs tell you what actions you must take in order to protect yourself from recently-discovered security vulnerabilities. In most cases, security vulnerabilities are addressed by [updating normally](/doc/how-to-update/). However, in some cases, special user action is required. In all cases, the required actions are detailed in QSBs.

## What are the PGP signatures that accompany QSBs?

A [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) signature is a cryptographic [digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) made in accordance with the [OpenPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP) standard. PGP signatures can be cryptographically verified with programs like [GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)](https://gnupg.org/). The Qubes security team cryptographically signs all QSBs so that Qubes users have a reliable way to check whether QSBs are genuine. The only way to be certain that a QSB is authentic is by verifying its PGP signatures.

## Why should I care whether a QSB is authentic?

A forged QSB could deceive you into taking actions that adversely affect the security of your Qubes OS system, such as installing malware or making configuration changes that render your system vulnerable to attack. Falsified QSBs could sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the security of Qubes OS or the status of the Qubes OS Project.

## How do I verify the PGP signatures on a QSB?

The following command-line instructions assume a Linux system with `git` and `gpg` installed. (See [here](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/verifying-signatures.html#openpgp-software) for Windows and Mac options.)

1. Obtain the Qubes Master Signing Key (QMSK), e.g.:

   ```shell_session
   $ gpg --fetch-keys https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-master-signing-key.asc
   gpg: directory '/home/user/.gnupg' created
   gpg: keybox '/home/user/.gnupg/pubring.kbx' created
   gpg: requesting key from 'https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-master-signing-key.asc'
   gpg: /home/user/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
   gpg: key DDFA1A3E36879494: public key "Qubes Master Signing Key" imported
   gpg: Total number processed: 1
   gpg:               imported: 1
   ```

   (See [here](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/verifying-signatures.html#how-to-import-and-authenticate-the-qubes-master-signing-key) for more ways to obtain the QMSK.)

2. View the fingerprint of the PGP key you just imported. (Note: `gpg>` indicates a prompt inside of the GnuPG program. Type what appears after it when prompted.)

   ```shell_session
   $ gpg --edit-key 0x427F11FD0FAA4B080123F01CDDFA1A3E36879494
   gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.27; Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
   There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
   
   
   pub  rsa4096/DDFA1A3E36879494
        created: 2010-04-01  expires: never       usage: SC
        trust: unknown       validity: unknown
   [ unknown] (1). Qubes Master Signing Key
   
   gpg> fpr
   pub   rsa4096/DDFA1A3E36879494 2010-04-01 Qubes Master Signing Key
    Primary key fingerprint: 427F 11FD 0FAA 4B08 0123  F01C DDFA 1A3E 3687 9494
   ```

3. **Important:** At this point, you still don't know whether the key you just imported is the genuine QMSK or a forgery. In order for this entire procedure to provide meaningful security benefits, you *must* authenticate the QMSK out-of-band. **Do not skip this step!** The standard method is to obtain the QMSK fingerprint from *multiple independent sources in several different ways* and check to see whether they match the key you just imported. See [here](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/verifying-signatures.html#how-to-import-and-authenticate-the-qubes-master-signing-key) for more details and ideas for how to do that.

   **Tip:** Record the genuine QMSK fingerprint in a safe place (or several) so that you don't have to repeat this step in the future.

4. Once you are satisfied that you have the genuine QMSK, set its trust level to 5 ("ultimate"), then quit GnuPG with `q`.

   ```shell_session
   gpg> trust
   pub  rsa4096/DDFA1A3E36879494
        created: 2010-04-01  expires: never       usage: SC
        trust: unknown       validity: unknown
   [ unknown] (1). Qubes Master Signing Key
   
   Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
   (by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)
   
     1 = I don't know or won't say
     2 = I do NOT trust
     3 = I trust marginally
     4 = I trust fully
     5 = I trust ultimately
     m = back to the main menu
   
   Your decision? 5
   Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y
   
   pub  rsa4096/DDFA1A3E36879494
        created: 2010-04-01  expires: never       usage: SC
        trust: ultimate      validity: unknown
   [ unknown] (1). Qubes Master Signing Key
   Please note that the shown key validity is not necessarily correct
   unless you restart the program.
   
   gpg> q
   ```

5. Use Git to clone the qubes-secpack repo.

   ```shell_session
   $ git clone https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack.git
   Cloning into 'qubes-secpack'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 4065, done.

   Resolving deltas: 100% (1910/1910), done.
   ```

6. Import the included PGP keys. (See our [PGP key policies](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/security-pack.html#pgp-key-policies) for important information about these keys.)

   ```shell_session

   gpg: depth: 1  valid:   6  signed:   0  trust: 6-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 0u
   ```

7. Verify signed Git tags.

   ```shell_session
   $ cd qubes-secpack/
   $ git tag -v `git describe`
   object 266e14a6fae57c9a91362c9ac784d3a891f4d351
   type commit
   tag marmarek_sec_266e14a6
   tagger Marek Marczykowski-Górecki 1677757924 +0100
   
   Tag for commit 266e14a6fae57c9a91362c9ac784d3a891f4d351
   gpg: Signature made Thu 02 Mar 2023 03:52:04 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key 2D1771FE4D767EDC76B089FAD655A4F21830E06A
   gpg: Good signature from "Marek Marczykowski-Górecki (Qubes security pack)" [full]
   ```

   The exact output will differ, but the final line should always start with `gpg: Good signature from...` followed by an appropriate key. The `[full]` indicates full trust, which this key inherits in virtue of being validly signed by the QMSK.

8. Verify PGP signatures, e.g.:

   ```shell_session
   $ cd QSBs/
   $ gpg --verify qsb-087-2022.txt.sig.marmarek qsb-087-2022.txt
   gpg: Signature made Wed 23 Nov 2022 04:05:51 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key 2D1771FE4D767EDC76B089FAD655A4F21830E06A
   gpg: Good signature from "Marek Marczykowski-Górecki (Qubes security pack)" [full]
   $ gpg --verify qsb-087-2022.txt.sig.simon qsb-087-2022.txt
   gpg: Signature made Wed 23 Nov 2022 03:50:42 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key EA18E7F040C41DDAEFE9AA0F4AC18DE1112E1490
   gpg: Good signature from "Simon Gaiser (Qubes Security Pack signing key)" [full]
   $ cd ../canaries/
   $ gpg --verify canary-034-2023.txt.sig.marmarek canary-034-2023.txt
   gpg: Signature made Thu 02 Mar 2023 03:51:48 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key 2D1771FE4D767EDC76B089FAD655A4F21830E06A
   gpg: Good signature from "Marek Marczykowski-Górecki (Qubes security pack)" [full]
   $ gpg --verify canary-034-2023.txt.sig.simon canary-034-2023.txt
   gpg: Signature made Thu 02 Mar 2023 01:47:52 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key EA18E7F040C41DDAEFE9AA0F4AC18DE1112E1490
   gpg: Good signature from "Simon Gaiser (Qubes Security Pack signing key)" [full]
   ```

   Again, the exact output will differ, but the final line of output from each `gpg --verify` command should always start with `gpg: Good signature from...` followed by an appropriate key.


For this announcement (QSB-094), the commands are:

```
$ gpg --verify qsb-094-2023.txt.sig.marmarek qsb-094-2023.txt
$ gpg --verify qsb-094-2023.txt.sig.simon qsb-094-2023.txt
```

You can also verify the signatures directly from this announcement in addition to or instead of verifying the files from the qubes-secpack. Simply copy and paste the QSB-094 text into a plain text file and do the same for both signature files. Then, perform the same authentication steps as listed above, substituting the filenames above with the names of the files you just created.
