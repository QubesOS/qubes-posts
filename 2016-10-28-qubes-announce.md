We've just introduced a new mailing list: [qubes-announce]

This is a read-only list for those who wish to receive only very important,
infrequent messages. Only the core Qubes team can post to this list, and only
[Qubes Security Bulletins (QSBs)][qsb] and new Qubes OS releases will be
announced here. Instructions for subscribing to the list are available
[here][qubes-announce].
