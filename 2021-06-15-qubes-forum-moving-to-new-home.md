_**Update:** The migration has been completed successfully!_

Since the [Qubes Forum](https://qubes-os.discourse.group) first [launched](/news/2020/08/20/new-discussion-forum-for-qubes-os-users/) over nine months ago, it's been far more popular than we anticipated! While this has been a pleasant surprise, one consequence is that we've outgrown the [free hosting for open source projects](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/11/free-hosting-for-open-source-v2/) that [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) has generously been providing to us. As a result, we must switch to a new paid host. We're also taking this opportunity to move the forum to our official domain!

In order to ensure a smooth and orderly transition, we're announcing these changes well in advance. The move is scheduled for **2021-07-01 (July 1)**, which is a little over two weeks from the date of this announcement. We hope this gives everyone sufficient time to prepare so that the transition doesn't come as a surprise.

Once the move has been completed, the forum's new address will be:

<https://forum.qubes-os.org>

**Again, this link will *not* take you to a fully functional forum until the migration on 2021-07-01.**
We hope that this new address better reflects the forum's [official nature](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/introduction/support.html#forum), as well as being intuitive and easy to remember. :)

Rest assured, we'll be taking a full backup of the current forum and copying everything over to the new forum, including all categories, topics, posts, private messages, and even likes! After the migration, the old forum will automatically redirect visitors to the new address for at least a few months.

We'd like to thank you, the Qubes community, for making the forum a success. Your passion and engagement helps the project grow as we continue our journey together. On a personal note, I'd also like to give special recognition to a few individuals whose efforts made this forum possible to begin with and continue to sustain it. Thank you, [deeplow](/team/#deeplow), [Simon Newton](/team/#simon-newton), and [Michael Carbone](/team/#michael-carbone) for your tireless work. We wouldn't have this forum without you!

## Important note for U2F two-factor authentication users

If you're using a U2F key for two-factor authentication (2FA) on the forum, you'll have to use a backup code in order to log in on the new domain. Alternatively, you can disable two-factor authentication before the migration and re-enable it afterward. **Please make sure you have either saved a copy of your backup codes or disabled 2FA before 2021-07-01, or you will be locked out of your forum account!**
