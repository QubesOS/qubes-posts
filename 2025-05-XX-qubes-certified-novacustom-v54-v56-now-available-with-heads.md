The [NovaCustom](https://novacustom.com/) [V54 Series](/doc/certified-hardware/novacustom-v54-series/) and [V56 Series](/doc/certified-hardware/novacustom-v56-series/) laptops, both of which are already [officially certified](/doc/certified-hardware/) for Qubes OS 4, are now available with [Heads](https://osresearch.net/), which is a new Qubes-certified firmware option for these models.

 When you configure your [V54 Series](https://novacustom.com/product/v54-series/) or [V56 Series](https://novacustom.com/product/v56-series/) laptop on the NovaCustom website, you can now opt for Heads by selecting the firmware option that says, "Yes - deploy coreboot+Heads (instead of coreboot+EDK-II)." Current owners of these models can also upgrade to coreboot+Heads with the [Dasharo Pro Package](https://novacustom.com/product/dasharo-pro-package/). If you'd prefer not to use Heads, that's also fine. The original coreboot+EDK-II firmware option remains certified.
