Fedora 28 has reached EOL ([end-of-life]). We strongly recommend that
all Qubes users upgrade their Fedora 28 TemplateVMs and StandaloneVMs to
Fedora 29 immediately. We provide step-by-step upgrade instructions for
upgrading from [Fedora 28 to 29]. For a complete list of TemplateVM
versions supported for your specific version of Qubes, see [Supported
TemplateVM Versions].

We also provide a fresh Fedora 29 TemplateVM package through the
official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following
the standard [installation instructions].

After upgrading your TemplateVMs, please remember to set all qubes that
were using the old template to use the new one. The instructions to do
this can be found in the upgrade instructions for [Fedora 28 to 29].

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in
dom0. For details, please see our [Note on dom0 and EOL].
