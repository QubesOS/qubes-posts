title: Qubes OS 3.2 has been released

I'm happy to announce that today we're releasing Qubes OS 3.2!

This is an incremental improvement over the 3.1 version that we
[released][qubes_31_anon] earlier this year.  A lot of work went into making
this release more polished, more stable and easier to use than our previous
releases.

One major feature that we've improved upon in this release is our integrated
management infrastructure, which was introduced in Qubes 3.1. Whereas before it
was only possible to manage whole VMs, it is now possible to manage the
_insides_ of VMs as well.

The principal challenge we faced was how to allow such a tight integration of
the management engine software (for which we use [Salt]) with potentially
untrusted VMs without opening a large attack surface on the (complex) management
code. We believe we found an elegant solution to this problem, which we've
implemented in Qubes 3.2.

We now use this management functionality for basic system setup during
installation, for preparing our automatic tests, and for applying various custom
configurations. In the future, we envision a simple GUI application allowing
users to download ready-to-use Salt recipes for setting up various things, for
example:

 * Pre-configured apps optimized to take advantage of Qubes'
   compartmentalization, such as Thunderbird with Qubes [Split GPG]
 * UI and system-wide customizations for specific use cases
 * Corporate remote management and integration

These features are planned for the upcoming Qubes 4.x releases.

In Qubes 3.2, we're also introducing [USB passthrough][qubes_usb], which allows
one to assign individual USB devices, such as cameras, Bitcoin hardware wallets,
and various FTDI devices, to AppVMs. This means that it's now possible to use
Skype and other video conferencing software on Qubes!

Qubes has supported the sandboxing of USB devices since the very beginning
(2010), but the catch has always been that all the USB devices connected to the
same USB _controller_ had to be assigned to the same VM. This limitation was due
to the underlying hardware architecture (specifically, PCIe and VT-d
technologies).

We can now get around this limitation by using software backends. The price we
pay for this, however, is increased attack surface on the backend, which is
important in the event that several USB devices of different security contexts
are connected to a single controller. Sadly, on laptops this is almost always
the case. Another potential security problem is that USB virtualization does
_not_ prevent a potentially malicious USB device from attacking the VM to which
it is connected.

These problems are not inherent to Qubes OS. In fact, they pose an even greater
threat to traditional, monolithic operating systems. In the case of Qubes, it
has at least been possible to isolate all USB devices from the user's AppVMs.
The new USB passthrough feature gives the user more fine-grained control over
the management of USB devices while still maintaining this isolation.
Nonetheless, it's very important for users to realize that there are no
"automagical" solutions to malicious USB problems. Users should plan their
compartmentalization with this in mind.

We should also mention that Qubes has long supported the secure virtualization
of a certain class of USB devices, specifically [mass storage
devices][qubes_usb] (such as flash drives and external hard drives) and, more
recently, [USB mice][qubes_hid]. Please note that it is always preferable to use
these special, security-optimized protocols when available rather than generic
USB passthrough.

Eye-candy-wise, we have switched from KDE to Xfce4 as the default desktop
environment in dom0. The reasons for the switch are stability, performance, and
aesthetics, as explained [here][xfce4_switch_ticket]. While we hope the new
default desktop environment will provide a better experience for all users,
Qubes 3.2 also supports KDE, awesome, and i3 window managers.

For other features and improvements, please see the [release
notes][qubes_32_release_notes].

The ISO can be downloaded [here][qubes_32_iso]. As usual, we strongly encourage
users to verify the integrity of the downloaded image, as explained
[here][sig_verification].

Existing users on Qubes 3.1 may choose to perform an [in-place upgrade], though
a clean installation is recommended. Users on any of the Qubes 3.2 release
candidates can simply update their systems normally in order to be upgraded to
the stable 3.2 release.

I'd like to thank the whole [team] for their work and engagement!
