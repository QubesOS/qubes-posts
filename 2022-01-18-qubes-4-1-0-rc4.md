The fourth release candidate for Qubes 4.1.0 is here! There are no major
changes to report. We've just focused on fixing bugs that were
discovered and reported in the third release candidate.

If you're currently using any Qubes 4.1.0 release candidate, a regular
[update] is sufficient to upgrade to the latest one. Otherwise, read on
for more about how to get started with testing Qubes 4.1.0-rc4.


What's new in Qubes 4.1.0?
--------------------------

In case you still haven't heard, Qubes 4.1.0 includes several major new
features, each of which is explained in depth in its own article:

- [Qubes Architecture Next Steps: The GUI Domain]
- [Qubes Architecture Next Steps: The New Qrexec Policy System]
- [New Gentoo templates and maintenance infrastructure]
- [Reproducible builds for Debian: a big step forward]

There are also  numerous other improvements and bug fixes listed in the
[release notes] and in the [issue tracker].

Finally, Qubes 4.1.0 features the following updated default components:

- Xen 4.14

How to test Qubes 4.1.0-rc4
---------------------------

If you're willing to [test] this release candidate, you can help to
improve the stable release by [reporting any bugs you encounter].
Experienced users are strongly encouraged to join the [testing team]!

How to migrate to 4.1.0-rc4:

- If you're already on any 4.1.0 release candidate, simply perform a
  normal [update].
- If you're not on a 4.1.0 release candidate yet, you have two options:
  1. [Back up] your current installation, [download] 4.1.0-rc4, perform
     a [fresh install], then [restore] from your backup.
  2. Perform an [in-place upgrade].


Release candidate planning
--------------------------

With each new release candidate, Qubes 4.1.0 becomes more stable as
testers report bugs and our developers fix them. As explained in our
general [release schedule], this cycle will continue until no major bugs
are discovered, at which point the last release candidate will be
declared the stable 4.1.0 release. Until then, we plan to have new
release candidates approximately every five weeks.
