The third release candidate for Qubes 4.1 is here! There are no major
changes to report. We've just focused on fixing bugs that were
discovered and reported in the second release candidate.

If you're currently using any Qubes 4.1 release candidate, a
regular [update] is sufficient to upgrade to the latest one. Otherwise,
read on for more about how to get started with testing Qubes 4.1-rc3.


What's new in Qubes 4.1?
------------------------

In case you still haven't heard, Qubes 4.1 includes several major new
features, each of which is explained in depth in its own article:

- [Qubes Architecture Next Steps: The GUI Domain]
- [Qubes Architecture Next Steps: The New Qrexec Policy System]
- [New Gentoo templates and maintenance infrastructure]
- [Reproducible builds for Debian: a big step forward]

There are also  numerous other improvements and bug fixes listed in the
[release notes] and in the [issue tracker].

Finally, Qubes 4.1 features the following updated default components:

- Xen 4.14
- Fedora 32 in dom0
- Fedora 34 template
- Debian 11 template
- Whonix 16 Gateway and Workstation templates
- Linux kernel 5.10


How to test Qubes 4.1-rc3
-------------------------

If you're willing to [test] this release candidate, you can help to
improve the stable release by [reporting any bugs you encounter].
Experienced users are strongly encouraged to join the [testing team]!

How to migrate to 4.1-rc3:

- If you're already on any 4.1 release candidate, simply perform a
  normal [update].
- If you're not on a 4.1 release candidate yet, you have two options:
  1. [Back up] your current installation, [download] 4.1-rc3, perform a
     [fresh install], then [restore] from your backup.
  2. Perform an [in-place upgrade].


Release candidate planning
--------------------------

With each new release candidate, Qubes 4.1 becomes more and more stable
as our testers report more bugs, and our developers fix them. As
explained in our general [release schedule], this cycle will continue
until no major bugs are discovered, at which point the last release
candidate will be declared the stable 4.1 release. Until then, we plan
to have new release candidates approximately every five weeks.
