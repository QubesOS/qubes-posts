We're pleased to announce the first release candidate for Qubes OS
4.0.4.

Qubes OS 4.0.4-rc1 includes many updates over the initial 4.0 release,
in particular:

- All 4.0 dom0 updates to date
- Fedora 32 TemplateVM
- Debian 10 TemplateVM
- Whonix 15 Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs
- Linux kernel 4.19 by default

Qubes 4.0.4-rc1 is available on the [downloads] page.


What is a point release?
------------------------

A point release does not designate a separate, new version of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 4.0) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 4.0 and fully updating it results in the same system as installing
Qubes 4.0.4.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you installed Qubes 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2, or 4.0.3 and have [fully
updated], then your system is already equivalent to a Qubes 4.0.4
installation. No further action is required.

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 4.0 for any reason, then the 4.0.4 ISO makes this more convenient
and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 4.0 updates to date. Please see
the [installation guide] for detailed instructions.

If you're willing to [test] this release candidate, you can help to
improve the stable release by [reporting any bugs you encounter].


Release candidate planning
--------------------------

If no major issues are discovered in 4.0.4-rc1, we expect to announce
the stable release of 4.0.4 in a couple weeks.
