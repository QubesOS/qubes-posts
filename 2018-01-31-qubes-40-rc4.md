We're pleased to announce the fourth release candidate for Qubes 4.0!
This release contains important safeguards against the [Spectre and
Meltdown attacks][qsb-37], as well as bug fixes for many of the issues
discovered in the [previous release candidate][4.0-rc3]. A full list of
the Qubes 4.0 issues closed so far is available [here][closed-issues].
Further details about this release, including full installation
instructions, are available in the [Qubes 4.0 release
notes][release-notes]. The new installation image is available on the
[Downloads] page.

As always, we're immensely grateful to our community of testers for
taking the time to [discover and report bugs]. Thanks to your efforts,
we're able to fix these bugs *before* the final release of Qubes 4.0. We
encourage you to continue diligently testing this fourth release
candidate so that we can work together to improve Qubes 4.0 before the
stable release.

Major changes in Qubes 4.0-rc4
------------------------------

The Qubes VM Manager is back by popular demand! The returning Qubes
Manager will be slightly different from the 3.2 version. Specifically,
it will not duplicate functionality that is already provided by the new
4.0 widgets. Specific examples include attaching and detaching block
devices, attaching and detaching the microphone, and VM CPU usage.

In addition, the default TemplateVMs have been upgraded to Fedora 26 and
Debian 9.

The Qubes 4.0 stable release
----------------------------

If the testing of 4.0-rc4 does not reveal any major problems, we hope to
declare it the stable 4.0 release without any further significant
changes. In this scenario, any bugs discovered during the testing
process would be fixed in subsequent updates.

If, on the other hand, a major issue is discovered, we will continue
with the standard [release schedule], and Qubes 4.0 stable will be a
separate, later release.

Current Qubes 4.0 Users
-----------------------

Current users of Qubes 4.0-rc3 can upgrade in-place by downloading the
latest updates from the testing repositories in both
[dom0][dom0-testing] and [TemplateVMs][domU-testing]. As explained in
[QSB #37][qsb-37], Qubes 4.0-rc4 uses PVH instead of HVM for almost all
VMs without PCI devices by default as a security measure against
Meltdown, and this change will also be released as a patch for existing
Qubes 4.0 installations in the coming days. Therefore, current Qubes 4.0
users will benefit from this change whether they upgrade in-place from a
previous release candidate or perform a clean installation of 4.0-rc4.

If you wish to upgrade in-place and have manually changed your VM
settings, please note the following:

1. By default, Qubes 4.0-rc3 used kernel 4.9.x. However, PVH mode will
   require kernel >= 4.11. This is fine, because we will include kernel
   4.14 in the PVH update. However, if you have manually changed the
   kernel setting for any of your VMs, the update will not automatically
   override that setting. Those VMs will still be using an old kernel,
   so they will not work in PVH mode. Therefore, you must must either
   change their settings to use the new kernel or change the VM mode
   back to HVM.

2. If you have created a Windows VM, and you rely on it running in HVM
   mode, you must explicitly set its mode to HVM (since the default mode
   after applying the PVH update will be PVH rather than HVM). You can
   do this either through the VM Settings GUI or by using the
   `qvm-prefs` command-line tool to change the `virt_mode` property.
