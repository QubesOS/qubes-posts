We're pleased to announce that the [NovaCustom](https://novacustom.com/) [V54 Series](/doc/certified-hardware/novacustom-v54-series/) and [V56 Series](/doc/certified-hardware/novacustom-v56-series/) laptops, both of which are already [officially certified](/doc/certified-hardware/) for Qubes OS 4, are now available with [Heads](https://osresearch.net/), which is a new Qubes-certified firmware option for these models.

 When you configure your [V54 Series](https://novacustom.com/product/v54-series/) or [V56 Series](https://novacustom.com/product/v56-series/) laptop on the NovaCustom website, you can now choose Heads by selecting the firmware option labeled, "Yes - deploy coreboot+Heads (instead of coreboot+EDK-II)." Current owners of these models can also upgrade to Heads with the [Dasharo Pro Package](https://novacustom.com/product/dasharo-pro-package/).

Heads firmware enhances security by establishing a strong chain of trust, using the hardware TPM to protect against firmware manipulation, ensure boot verification, and support USB security device functionality during startup. However, if you'd prefer not to use Heads for any reason, the original coreboot+EDK-II firmware option remains certified.
