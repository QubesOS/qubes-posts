Fedora 31 has reached EOL ([end-of-life]). If you have not already done so, we strongly recommend upgrading your Fedora 31 TemplateVMs and StandaloneVMs to Fedora 32 immediately. We provide step-by-step upgrade instructions for [upgrading Fedora TemplateVMs]. For a complete list of TemplateVM versions supported for your specific version of Qubes, see the list of [supported TemplateVM versions].

We also provide a fresh Fedora 32 TemplateVM package through the official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following the standard [installation instructions].

After upgrading your TemplateVMs, please remember to [switch all qubes that were using the old template to use the new one][switching].

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in dom0. For details, please see our [note on dom0 and EOL].
