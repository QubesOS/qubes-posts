As [previously announced](/news/2022/07/04/qubes-os-4-0-eol-on-2022-08-04/), all releases in the Qubes 4.0 series (which includes the most recent 4.0.4 patch release) have officially reached EOL (end-of-life) as of today, 2022-08-04. We strongly urge all remaining Qubes 4.0 users to [upgrade to Qubes 4.1](/doc/upgrade/4.1/) immediately. As always, the support statuses of all Qubes OS and template releases are available on the [supported releases](/doc/supported-releases/) page, and the latest release is available to download on the [downloads](/downloads/) page.


## What should I do?

If you're already using Qubes 4.1, then no action is required on your part. This announcement concerns only the 4.0 minor release series.

If you're still using Qubes 4.0 (including the most recent 4.0.4 patch release), then you should upgrade to 4.1 immediately. You have two options:

- Perform a clean reinstallation using the latest stable [Qubes 4.1.1 ISO](/downloads/), which was [published on 2022-07-18](/news/2022/07/18/qubes-4-1-1/).
- Perform an [in-place upgrade](/doc/upgrade/4.1/#in-place-upgrade) to 4.1.

Both of these options are covered in further detail in the [Qubes 4.0 to 4.1 upgrade guide](/doc/upgrade/4.1/). If you need help, please consult our [help and support](/support/) page.
