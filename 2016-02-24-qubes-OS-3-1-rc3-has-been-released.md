Today we're releasing the third release candidate of Qubes 3.1, with some
(hopefully) last few important bugs fixed over the 
[previous release candidate][qubes-31-rc2-announced].

Read the [release notes][release-notes] for more details, installation and update
instructions. The installation image can be downloaded from [here][download].

We would like to thanks all the users testing release candidates and all the
bug reports! This allows us to make the final release as stable as possible.
