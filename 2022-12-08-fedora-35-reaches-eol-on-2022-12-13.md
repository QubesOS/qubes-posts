The Fedora Project has [announced](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/OGTVKLX7OXBYCEUQ66UY4YK3T6QHAYW5/) that Fedora 35 will reach EOL ([end-of-life](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life)) on 2022-12-13. We strongly recommend that all users [upgrade](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/fedora/fedora.html#upgrading) their Fedora templates and standalones to Fedora 36 no later than 2022-12-13.

We provide fresh Fedora 36 template packages through the official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following the standard [installation instructions](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/fedora/fedora.html#installing). Alternatively, we also provide step-by-step instructions for [performing an in-place upgrade](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/fedora/fedora-upgrade.html) of an existing Fedora template. After upgrading your templates, please remember to [switch all qubes that were using the old template to use the new one](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/templates.html#switching).

For a complete list of template releases that are supported for your specific Qubes release, see our [supported template releases](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/downloading-installing-upgrading/supported-releases.html#templates).

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in dom0. For details, please see our [note on dom0 and EOL](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/downloading-installing-upgrading/supported-releases.html#note-on-dom0-and-eol).
