**Update (2020-01-15):** The [kernel bug][#5553] has now been fixed, and
the new ISO has been [released as Qubes 4.0.3-rc1]. Please see that
announcement for further details.

**Update (2020-01-08):** Shortly after this announcement was originally
published, a [bug][#5553] was discovered in the dom0 kernel included in
Qubes 4.0.2. Since this bug would present installation problems for the
majority of users, we have temporarily removed it from the [Downloads]
page and reinstated the latest release candidate (Qubes 4.0.2-rc3) in
its place.

-----

We're pleased to announce the release of Qubes 4.0.2! This is the second
stable patch release of Qubes 4.0. It includes many updates over the
initial 4.0 release, in particular:

- All 4.0 dom0 updates to date
- Fedora 30 TemplateVM
- Debian 10 TemplateVM
- Whonix 15 Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs
- Linux kernel 4.19 by default

Qubes 4.0.2 is available on the [Downloads] page.


What is a patch release?
------------------------

A patch release does not designate a separate, new major or minor release of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 4.0) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 4.0 and fully updating it results in the same system as installing
Qubes 4.0.2.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you installed Qubes 4.0 or 4.0.1 and have [fully updated], then
your system is already equivalent to a Qubes 4.0.2 installation. No
further action is required.

Similarly, if you're currently using a Qubes 4.0.2 release candidate
(4.0.2-rc1, 4.0.2-rc2, or 4.0.2-rc3), and your system is [fully
updated], then your system is equivalent to a 4.0.2 stable installation,
and no additional action is needed.

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 4.0 for any reason, then the 4.0.2 ISO makes this more convenient
and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 4.0 updates to date.

**Note:** At 4.5 GiB, the Qubes 4.0.2 ISO will not fit on a
single-layer DVD (for the technical details underlying this, please see
issue [#5367]). Instead, we recommend [copying the ISO onto a
sufficiently large USB drive][copy-iso]. However, if you would prefer to
use optical media, we suggest selecting a dual-layer DVD or Blu-ray disc.

Thank you to all the release candidate users for testing this release
and [reporting issues]!
