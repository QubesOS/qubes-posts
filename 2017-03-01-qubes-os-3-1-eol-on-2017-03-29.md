Qubes OS releases are normally supported for six months after each subsequent
major or minor release (see [Supported Versions] and [Version Scheme]). In
accordance with this policy, Qubes 3.1, which was released on 2016-03-09, is
scheduled to reach end-of-life (EOL) on 2017-03-29 --- six months after Qubes
3.2 was released on 2016-09-29. We strongly urge all current Qubes 3.1 users to
upgrade to Qubes 3.2 or newer before 2017-03-29. As always, newer releases are
available on the [downloads] page.
