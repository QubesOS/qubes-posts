After nearly two years in development and countless hours of testing,
we're pleased to announce the stable release of Qubes OS 4.0!

Major changes in version 4.0
----------------------------

Version 4.0 includes several fundamental improvements to the security
and functionality of Qubes OS:

 * [The Qubes Admin API][admin-api]
 * [Qubes Core Stack version 3][core3]
 * [Fully virtualized VMs for enhanced security][qsb-37]
 * [Multiple, flexible Disposable VM templates][dispvm]
 * [A more expressive, user-friendly Qubes RPC policy
   system][qrexec-doc]
 * [A powerful new VM volume manager that makes it easy to keep VMs on
   external drives][storage]
 * Enhanced TemplateVM security via [split packages] and [network
   interface removal][qrexec-proxy]
 * More secure backups with [`scrypt` for stronger key
   derivation][backup4] and enforced encryption
 * [Rewritten command-line tools with new options][4.0-cli]

This release delivers on the features we promised in our [announcement
of Qubes 4.0-rc1][4.0-rc1], with some course corrections along the way,
such as the switch from HVM to PVH for most VMs in response to [Meltdown
and Spectre][qsb-37].  For more details, please see the full [Release
Notes].  The Qubes 4.0 installation image is available on the
[Downloads] page, along with the complete [Installation Guide].

Current 4.0 release candidate users
-----------------------------------

In our [Qubes 4.0-rc5 announcement][4.0-rc5], we explained that if the
testing of 4.0-rc5 did not reveal any major problems, we would declare
it to be the stable 4.0 release without any further significant changes
and that, in this scenario, any bugs discovered during the testing
process would be fixed in subsequent updates. This is, in fact, what has
occurred.  We found that, with the fifth release candidate, 4.0 had
finally reached a level of stability that met our standards such that we
were comfortable designating it the stable release. Accordingly, current
users of 4.0-rc5 can upgrade in-place by downloading the latest updates
from the **stable** repositories in both [dom0] and [TemplateVMs].

We know that this stable release has been a long time in coming for many
you.  We sincerely appreciate your patience. Thank you for sticking with
us.  We're especially grateful to all of you who have contributed [code]
and [documentation] to this release, [tested] release candidates, and
diligently [reported bugs]. This stable release would not have been
possible without your efforts. Your involvement makes Qubes a truly
open-source project. Your energy, skill, and good will make this project
a joy to work on. We are lucky to have you.

The past and the future
-----------------------

Since first [announcing extended support for Qubes 3.2][3.2-extended],
we determined that users would be better served by having a version of
Qubes 3.2 with updated TemplateVMs and a newer kernel. We've designated
this release Qubes 3.2.1. As the name suggests, this is a patch release
for Qubes 3.2 that does not contain any major changes, and it is this
release to which the extended support period will apply. We intend for
Qubes 3.2.1 to be a viable alternative to version 4.0 for those who wish
to use Qubes on hardware that does not meet the [system requirements for
Qubes 4.0][4.x-sysreq]. While our [standard policy][qubes-ver] is to
support each Qubes release for six months after the next major or minor
release, the special extension for 3.2.1 raises this period to one full
year. Therefore, the stable release of Qubes 4.0 sets the EOL
(end-of-life) date for Qubes 3.2.1 at one year from today on 2019-03-28.
We expect 3.2.1 to be available soon, after Kernel 4.9 testing is
completed.

Looking forward, our work on Qubes 4.x has only just begun. Our sights
are now set on Qubes 4.1, for which we have [a growing
list][4.1-enhancements] of planned enhancements to nearly every aspect
of Qubes OS. Whether you're new to Qubes or have been here for years, we
welcome you to [join us and get involved][contributing]. We've
personally chosen to devote our time and skills to making Qubes freely
available to the world because we believe that being open-source is
essential to Qubes being trustworthy and secure. If Qubes is valuable to
you, we ask that you please consider making a [donation] to the project.
With your support, we can continue to make reasonable security a reality
for many years to come.
