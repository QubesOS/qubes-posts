Dear Qubes Community,

We have just updated Qubes Security Bulletin (QSB) #37:
Information leaks due to processor speculative execution bugs.

The text of the main changes are reproduced below. For the full
text, please see the complete QSB in the qubes-secpack:

Changelog
==========

2018-01-11: Original QSB published
2018-01-23: Updated mitigation plan to XPTI; added Xen package versions
2018-03-14: Updated package versions with Spectre SP2 mitigations

[...]

(Proper) patching
==================

## Qubes 4.0

[...]

Additionally, Xen provided patches to mitigate Spectre variant 2. While
we don't believe this variant is reliably exploitable to obtain
sensitive information from other domains, it is possible to use it
for help with other attacks inside a domain (like escaping a sandbox
of web browser). This mitigation to be fully effective require
updated microcode - refer to your BIOS vendor for updates.

The specific packages that contain the XPTI and Spectre variant 2
patches for Qubes 4.0 are as follows:

  - Xen packages, version 4.8.3-3

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qubes VM Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

A system restart will be required afterwards.

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new Xen
binaries.
