The Fedora Project announced today that Fedora 27 has reached EOL
([end-of-life]). We strongly recommend that all Qubes users upgrade
their Fedora 27 TemplateVMs and StandaloneVMs to Fedora 28 immediately.
We provide step-by-step upgrade instructions for upgrading from [Fedora
27 to 28]. For a complete list of TemplateVM versions supported for your
specific version of Qubes, see [Supported TemplateVM Versions].

We also provide a fresh Fedora 28 TemplateVM package through the
official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following
the standard [installation instructions].

After upgrading your TemplateVMs, please remember to set all qubes that
were using the old template to use the new one. The instructions to do
this can be found in the upgrade instructions for [Fedora 27 to 28].

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in
dom0. For details, please see our [Note on dom0 and EOL].
