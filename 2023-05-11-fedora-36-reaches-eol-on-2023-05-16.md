The Fedora Project has [announced](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/4GXBZJSGQ2PEKIBM2APCTLXBS6IDKSOP/) that Fedora 36 will reach EOL ([end-of-life](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life)) on 2023-05-16. We strongly recommend that all users [upgrade](/doc/templates/fedora/#upgrading) their Fedora templates and standalones to [Fedora 37](/news/2023/03/03/fedora-37-templates-available/) no later than 2023-05-16.

We provide fresh Fedora 37 template packages through the official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following the standard [installation instructions](/doc/templates/fedora/#installing). Alternatively, we also provide step-by-step instructions for [performing an in-place upgrade](/doc/templates/fedora/in-place-upgrade/) of an existing Fedora template. After upgrading your templates, please remember to [switch all qubes that were using the old template to use the new one](/doc/templates/#switching).

For a complete list of template releases that are supported for your specific Qubes release, see our [supported template releases](/doc/supported-releases/#templates).

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in dom0. For details, please see our [note on dom0 and EOL](/doc/supported-releases/#note-on-dom0-and-eol).
