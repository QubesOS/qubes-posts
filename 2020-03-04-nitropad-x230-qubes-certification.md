It is our pleasure to announce that the [NitroPad X230] has become the
second [Qubes-certified Laptop][laptop] for Qubes 4.0! This makes
[Nitrokey] the first vendor in Europe to have a product pass Qubes
hardware certification.


## What is Qubes Certified Hardware?

[Qubes Certified Hardware] is hardware that has been certified by the
Qubes developers as compatible with Qubes OS. Beginning with Qubes 4.0,
in order to achieve certification, the hardware must satisfy a rigorous
set of [requirements], and the vendor must commit to offering customers
the very same configuration (same motherboard, same screen, same BIOS
version, same Wi-Fi module, etc.) for at least one year.

[Qubes-certified Laptops][laptop], in particular, are regularly tested
by the Qubes developers to ensure compatibility with all of Qubes'
features. The developers test all new major versions and updates to
ensure that no regressions are introduced.

It is important to note, however, that Qubes Hardware Certification
certifies only that a particular hardware *configuration* is *supported*
by Qubes. The Qubes OS Project takes no responsibility for any
manufacturing or shipping processes, nor can we control whether physical
hardware is modified (whether maliciously or otherwise) *en route* to
the user. (However, see below for information about how the Insurgo team
mitigates this risk.)
