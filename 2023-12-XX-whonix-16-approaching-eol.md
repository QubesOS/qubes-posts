Whonix 16 is currently [scheduled](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Qubes_Hosts) to reach EOL (end-of-life) on 2024-01-18. We strongly recommend that all users upgrade their Whonix templates and standalones to Whonix 17 before then. For more information, see [Upgrading to avoid EOL](/doc/how-to-update/#upgrading-to-avoid-eol).

There are two ways to upgrade your template to a new Whonix release:

- **Recommended:** [Install a fresh template to replace the existing one.](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Install) **This option may be simpler for less experienced users.** After you install the new template, redo all desired template modifications and [switch everything that was set to the old template to the new template](/doc/templates/#switching).

- **Advanced:** [Perform an in-place upgrade of an existing Whonix template.](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Release_Upgrade_16_to_17) This option will preserve any modifications you've made to the template, **but it may be more complicated for less experienced users.**

For a complete list of template releases that are supported for your specific Qubes release, see our [supported template releases](/doc/supported-releases/#templates).
