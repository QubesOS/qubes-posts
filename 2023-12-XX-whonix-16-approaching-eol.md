Whonix 16 is currently [scheduled](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Qubes_Hosts) to reach EOL (end-of-life) on 2024-01-18. We strongly recommend that all users upgrade their Whonix templates and standalones to Whonix 17 before then. For more information, see [Upgrading to avoid EOL](/doc/how-to-update/#upgrading-to-avoid-eol). Please note that Whonix 17 is available only on Qubes OS 4.2.

There are three ways to upgrade your template to a new Whonix release:

- **Recommended:** Perform a [clean installation](/doc/installation-guide/) of [Qubes OS 4.2.0](/news/2023/12/18/qubes-os-4-2-0-has-been-released/), which comes with Whonix 17 templates preinstalled (if selected during installation).

- **Recommended:** [Install fresh Whonix templates to replace the existing ones.](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Install). After you install the new templates, redo all desired template modifications and [switch everything that was set to the old templates to the new templates](/doc/templates/#switching).

- **Advanced:** Perform an [in-place upgrade from Whonix 16 to Whonix 17](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Release_Upgrade_16_to_17). This option will preserve any modifications you've made to the templates, **but it may be more complicated for less experienced users.**

For a complete list of template releases that are supported for your specific Qubes release, see our [supported template releases](/doc/supported-releases/#templates).
