As [previously announced](/news/2024/06/18/qubes-os-4-1-has-reached-end-of-life-extended-security-support-continues-until-2024-07-31/), extended security support for Qubes OS 4.1 has ended as of yesterday, 2024-07-31. Qubes 4.1 will no longer receive updates of any kind, including security updates. We strongly recommend that any remaining Qubes 4.1 users [upgrade to Qubes 4.2](/doc/upgrade/4.2/) immediately.

## Recommended actions

If you're already using Qubes 4.2, then you don't have to do anything. This announcement doesn't affect you.

If you're still using Qubes 4.1, then you should upgrade to Qubes 4.2 immediately. There are two ways to do this:

1. Perform a [clean reinstallation](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/downloading-installing-upgrading/upgrade/4_2.html#clean-installation) using the latest stable [Qubes OS 4.2.2 ISO](/downloads/).
2. Perform an [in-place upgrade to Qubes 4.2](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/downloading-installing-upgrading/upgrade/4_2.html#in-place-upgrade).

Both of these options are covered in further detail in the [Qubes 4.1 to 4.2 upgrade guide](/doc/upgrade/4.2/). In either case, we strongly recommend [making a full backup](/doc/how-to-back-up-restore-and-migrate/) beforehand. If you need help, please consult our [help and support](/support/) page.
