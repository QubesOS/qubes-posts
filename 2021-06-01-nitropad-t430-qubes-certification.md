_**Update:** Please be advised that the i7-3632QM option is **not**
compatible with Qubes OS, as it does not support VT-d. The option
specifically tested by the Qubes team is the i5-3320M._

It is our pleasure to announce that the [NitroPad T430] has become the
third [Qubes-certified Laptop][laptop] for Qubes 4.0! This makes
[Nitrokey] the first vendor to have *two* products that pass Qubes
hardware certification, the other being the [NitroPad X230].


## What is Qubes Certified Hardware?

[Qubes Certified Hardware] is hardware that has been certified by the
Qubes developers as compatible with Qubes OS. All Qubes-certified
devices are available for purchase with Qubes OS preinstalled. Beginning
with Qubes 4.0, in order to achieve certification, the hardware must
satisfy a rigorous set of [requirements], and the vendor must commit to
offering customers the very same configuration (same motherboard, same
screen, same BIOS version, same Wi-Fi module, etc.) for at least one
year.

[Qubes-certified Laptops][laptop], in particular, are regularly tested
by the Qubes developers to ensure compatibility with all of Qubes'
features. The developers test all new major versions and updates to
ensure that no regressions are introduced.

It is important to note, however, that Qubes Hardware Certification
certifies only that a particular hardware *configuration* is *supported*
by Qubes. The Qubes OS Project takes no responsibility for any vendor's
manufacturing, shipping, payment, or other practices, nor can we control
whether physical hardware is modified (whether maliciously or otherwise)
*en route* to the user. (However, see below for information about how
this risk is mitigated.)
