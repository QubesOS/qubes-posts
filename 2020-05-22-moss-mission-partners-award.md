We're proud to announce that the Qubes OS Project has won a
[Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS)] award in the amount
of 128,000 USD. This generous one-year award will fund the work of
[Frédéric Pierret] on making Qubes more robust and stable, as well as
several key parts of [Nina Alter]'s extensive work on making Qubes more
user-friendly.

There are three separate tracks for MOSS awards. Qubes has won an
award in the [Mission Partners] track. As Mozilla explains, "The
Mission Partners track supports open source projects that significantly
advance Mozilla’s mission." It is a great honor for Qubes to be
recognized as such a project, and we're thrilled by the important work
that this award will enable.
