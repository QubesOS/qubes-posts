We're pleased to announce the second [release candidate](#what-is-a-release-candidate) for Qubes 4.1.2! This [patch release](#what-is-a-patch-release) aims to consolidate all the security patches, bug fixes, and upstream template OS upgrades that have occurred since prior Qubes 4.1 releases. Our goal is to provide a secure and convenient way for users to install (or reinstall) the latest stable Qubes release with an up-to-date ISO.

Qubes 4.1.2-rc2 is available on the [downloads](/downloads/) page.


## What's new in Qubes 4.1.2?

Qubes 4.1.2-rc2 includes numerous updates over the initial 4.1.0 release, in particular:

- All 4.1 dom0 updates to date
- Fedora 37 template
- USB keyboard support in the installer ([#7674](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7674))
- `kernel-latest` available as a boot option when starting the installer ([#5900](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5900))
- Fixes for bugs discovered in 4.1.2-rc1


## Testing Qubes 4.1.2-rc2

If you're willing to [test](/doc/testing/) this release candidate, you can help to improve the eventual stable release by [reporting any bugs you encounter](/doc/issue-tracking/). We strongly encourage experienced users to join the [testing team](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/joining-the-testing-team/5190)!

Thank you to everyone who tested and reported bugs in 4.1.2-rc1!


## Existing Qubes 4.1 users

If you're not interested in testing this release candidate, and you're already using Qubes 4.1, then you should simply [update normally](/doc/how-to-update/) (which includes [upgrading any EOL templates](/doc/how-to-update/#upgrading-to-avoid-eol) you might have) in order to make your system essentially equivalent to this patch release. No special action is required on your part.


## When is the stable release?

If no significant bugs are discovered in 4.1.2-rc2, we expect to announce the stable release of 4.1.2 in approximately one week.


## What is a release candidate?

A release candidate (RC) is a software build that has the potential to become a stable release, unless significant bugs are discovered in testing. Release candidates are intended for more advanced (or adventurous!) users who are comfortable testing early versions of software that are potentially buggier than stable releases. You can read more about Qubes OS [supported releases](/doc/supported-releases/) and the [version scheme](/doc/version-scheme/) in our documentation.


## What is a patch release?

The Qubes OS Project uses the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standard. Version numbers are written as `[major].[minor].[patch]`. Hence, we refer to releases that increment the third number as "patch releases." A patch release does not designate a separate, new major or minor release of Qubes OS. Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this case, 4.1) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. (See [supported releases](/doc/supported-releases/) for a comprehensive list of major and minor releases.) Installing any prior Qubes 4.1 release and fully [updating](/doc/how-to-update/) it results in essentially the same system as installing Qubes 4.1.2. You can learn more about how Qubes release versioning works in the [version scheme](/doc/version-scheme/) documentation.
