We are pleased to announce that the Qubes OS Project is now accepting [donations](/donate/) in the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency [Monero (XMR)](https://www.getmonero.org/) at the following address:

```

We have received an increasing number of requests for Monero as a donation method over the past few years. We are proud that Qubes is the OS of choice for so many privacy-conscious individuals, and we are pleased to be able to offer a more private donation method for those users to show their support.

As with our Bitcoin donation address, you can verify the authenticity of the Monero donation address via the [Qubes Security Pack](/security/pack/) in the [fund](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/tree/master/fund) directory. We also provide detailed instructions for [verifying the digital signatures](/security/pack/#how-to-obtain-verify-and-read).

As with all other donations, your Monero donations will [directly fund the Qubes OS Project](/donate/#how-is-my-donation-used). Since Qubes is free and open-source software, we do not earn any revenue by selling it. Instead, we rely on your financial support. If you rely on Qubes for secure computing in your work or personal life or see the value in our efforts, we would greatly appreciate your donation. Thank you!
