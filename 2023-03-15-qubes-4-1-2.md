We're pleased to announce the stable release of Qubes 4.1.2! This release aims to consolidate all the security patches, bug fixes, and upstream template OS upgrades that have occurred since the initial Qubes 4.1.0 release. Our goal is to provide a secure and convenient way for users to install (or reinstall) the latest stable Qubes release with an up-to-date ISO.

Qubes 4.1.2 is available on the [downloads](/downloads/) page.


## Existing installations

If you are already using any version of Qubes 4.1 (including 4.1.0, 4.1.1, 4.1.2-rc1, and 4.1.2-rc2), then you should simply [update normally](/doc/how-to-update/) (which includes [upgrading any EOL templates](/doc/how-to-update/#upgrading-to-avoid-eol) you might have) in order to make your system effectively equivalent to this stable Qubes 4.1.2 release. No reinstallation or other special action is required.


## New installations

If you would like to install Qubes OS for the first time or perform a clean reinstallation on an existing system, there has never been a better time to do so! Simply [download](/downloads/) the Qubes 4.1.2 ISO and follow our [installation guide](/doc/installation-guide/).


## What's new in Qubes 4.1.2?

Qubes 4.1.2 includes numerous updates over the initial 4.1.0 release, in particular:

- All 4.1 dom0 updates to date
- Fedora 37 template
- USB keyboard support in the installer ([#7674](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7674))
- `kernel-latest` available as a boot option when starting the installer ([#5900](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5900))


## What is a patch release?

The Qubes OS Project uses the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standard. Version numbers are written as `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. Hence, we refer to releases that increment the third number as "patch releases." A patch release does not designate a separate, new major or minor release of Qubes OS. Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this case, 4.1) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. (See [supported releases](/doc/supported-releases/) for a comprehensive list of major and minor releases.) Installing any prior Qubes 4.1 release and fully [updating](/doc/how-to-update/) it results in essentially the same system as installing Qubes 4.1.2. You can learn more about how Qubes release versioning works in the [version scheme](/doc/version-scheme/) documentation.


## Reminder: Qubes 4.0 has reached end-of-life

Qubes 4.0 [reached EOL (end-of-life) on 2022-08-04](/news/2022/07/04/qubes-os-4-0-eol-on-2022-08-04/). If you're still using Qubes 4.0, we strongly recommend upgrading to Qubes 4.1.
