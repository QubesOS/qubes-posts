New Fedora 38 templates are now available! We provide fresh Fedora 38 template packages (standard, [minimal](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/minimal-templates.html), and [Xfce](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/xfce-templates.html)) through the official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following the standard [installation instructions](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/fedora/fedora.html#installing). Alternatively, we also provide step-by-step instructions for [performing an in-place upgrade](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/fedora/fedora-upgrade.html) of an existing Fedora template. After upgrading your templates, please remember to [switch all qubes that were using the old template to use the new one](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/templates.html#switching).

As a reminder, [Fedora 36 has reached EOL](/news/2023/05/11/fedora-36-reaches-eol-on-2023-05-16/). If you have not already done so, we strongly recommend that you [upgrade](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/fedora/fedora.html#upgrading) all Fedora 36
templates and standalones to a [supported template release](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/downloading-installing-upgrading/supported-releases.html#templates) immediately.

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in dom0 (see our [note on dom0 and EOL](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/downloading-installing-upgrading/supported-releases.html#note-on-dom0-and-eol)).
