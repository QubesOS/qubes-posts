New Fedora 38 templates are now available! We provide fresh Fedora 38 template packages through the official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following the standard [installation instructions](/doc/templates/fedora/#installing). Alternatively, we also provide step-by-step instructions for [performing an in-place upgrade](/doc/templates/fedora/in-place-upgrade/) of an existing Fedora template. After upgrading your templates, please remember to [switch all qubes that were using the old template to use the new one](/doc/templates/#switching).

As a reminder, [Fedora 36 has reached EOL](/news/2023/05/11/fedora-36-reaches-eol-on-2023-05-16/). If you have not already done so, we strongly recommend that you [upgrade](/doc/templates/fedora/#upgrading) all Fedora 36
templates and standalones to a [supported template release](/doc/supported-releases/#templates) immediately.

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in dom0 (see our [note on dom0 and EOL](/doc/supported-releases/#note-on-dom0-and-eol)).
