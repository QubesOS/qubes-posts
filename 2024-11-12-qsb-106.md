     Information disclosure through uninitialized memory in libxl
                               (XSA-464)

Changelog
----------

2024-11-12: Original QSB
2024-11-29: Revise language

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

On 2024-11-12, the Xen Project published XSA-464, "libxl leaks data to PVH
guests via ACPI tables" (CVE-2024-45819) [3]:
| PVH guests have their ACPI tables constructed by the toolstack.  The
| construction involves building the tables in local memory, which are
| then copied into guest memory.  While actually used parts of the local
| memory are filled in correctly, excess space that is being allocated is
| left with its prior contents.

Qubes calls libxl via libvirtd. The memory that is not fully initialized
is allocated via malloc. So, the prior content that is leaked to a PVH
qube might be anything that has been previously allocated and
subsequently freed in the libvirtd process.

Impact
-------

The leaked memory usually doesn't contain important secrets, [4] but it
can reveal various information about other qubes and the host system
that would not otherwise be available to a malicious qube. In
particular, the following types of information might be present in
libvirtd's memory:

Information about other qubes:
 - Name
 - UUID
 - kernel version
 - kernel cmdline
 - IP/MAC addresses of virtual network devices (but not from physical
   devices) [5]
 - Assigned PCI devices

Information about the host system:
 - Total system memory
 - Available PCI devices
 - DMI/SYSBIOS information (serial number as reported by firmware, RAM
   DIMM product number, etc.)

These lists are not intended to be exhaustive. For example, they don't
include less-interesting qube settings like the assigned audio qube, but
they should cover all the important categories.

Note that a malicious qube has very little control over the information
leaked in the uninitialized memory to which it is exposed. [6]
Additionally, the leak happens only once per qube boot, so for a decent
chance of being exposed to interesting information, a malicious qube may
have to wait a long time in order to be exposed to a significant number
of normal qube boots. Alternatively, a  malicious qube could attempt to
provoke boots of disposable qubes it can control (for example, via
qubes.VMShell) or shut itself down and hope to be rebooted by the user
or a qrexec call. However, both of these methods would result in unusual
system activity that users would easily notice.

Affected systems
-----------------

All supported version of Qubes OS are affected.

Only qubes in PVH mode are affected. In the default configuration, this
includes all qubes except for sys-net and sys-usb.

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.17.5-4

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.

[4] The leaked memory could reveal the ASLR secret of the libvirtd
    process, but this is only useful when the attacker has knowledge of
    a memory vulnerability in libvirtd/libxl that is reachable in Qubes
    OS. Additionally, in an unusual custom setup, a user could have
    included a secret in some of the leaked information about other
    qubes.

[5] Unless the user actively configures something else for a qube, its
    IP addresses is based on its qid/dispid (a number from 0 to 10000),
    and the MAC addresses is the same for all qubes.

[6] When starting a disposable qube via qrexec, a malicious qube could
    try to time the start in its favor.

## What is the purpose of this announcement?

The purpose of this announcement is to inform the Qubes community that a new Qubes security bulletin (QSB) has been published.

## What is a Qubes security bulletin (QSB)?

A Qubes security bulletin (QSB) is a security announcement issued by the [Qubes security team](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/security.html#qubes-security-team). A QSB typically provides a summary and impact analysis of one or more recently-discovered software vulnerabilities, including details about patching to address them. For a list of all QSBs, see [Qubes security bulletins (QSBs)](/security/qsb/).

## Why should I care about QSBs?

QSBs tell you what actions you must take in order to protect yourself from recently-discovered security vulnerabilities. In most cases, security vulnerabilities are addressed by [updating normally](/doc/how-to-update/). However, in some cases, special user action is required. In all cases, the required actions are detailed in QSBs.

## What are the PGP signatures that accompany QSBs?

A [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) signature is a cryptographic [digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) made in accordance with the [OpenPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP) standard. PGP signatures can be cryptographically verified with programs like [GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)](https://gnupg.org/). The Qubes security team cryptographically signs all QSBs so that Qubes users have a reliable way to check whether QSBs are genuine. The only way to be certain that a QSB is authentic is by verifying its PGP signatures.

## Why should I care whether a QSB is authentic?

A forged QSB could deceive you into taking actions that adversely affect the security of your Qubes OS system, such as installing malware or making configuration changes that render your system vulnerable to attack. Falsified QSBs could sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the security of Qubes OS or the status of the Qubes OS Project.

## How do I verify the PGP signatures on a QSB?

The following command-line instructions assume a Linux system with `git` and `gpg` installed. (For Windows and Mac options, see [OpenPGP software](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/verifying-signatures.html#openpgp-software).)

1. Obtain the Qubes Master Signing Key (QMSK), e.g.:

   ```shell_session
   $ gpg --fetch-keys https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-master-signing-key.asc
   gpg: directory '/home/user/.gnupg' created
   gpg: keybox '/home/user/.gnupg/pubring.kbx' created
   gpg: requesting key from 'https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-master-signing-key.asc'
   gpg: /home/user/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
   gpg: key DDFA1A3E36879494: public key "Qubes Master Signing Key" imported
   gpg: Total number processed: 1
   gpg:               imported: 1
   ```

   (For more ways to obtain the QMSK, see [How to import and authenticate the Qubes Master Signing Key](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/verifying-signatures.html#how-to-import-and-authenticate-the-qubes-master-signing-key).)

2. View the fingerprint of the PGP key you just imported. (Note: `gpg>` indicates a prompt inside of the GnuPG program. Type what appears after it when prompted.)

   ```shell_session
   $ gpg --edit-key 0x427F11FD0FAA4B080123F01CDDFA1A3E36879494
   gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.27; Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
   There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
   
   
   pub  rsa4096/DDFA1A3E36879494
        created: 2010-04-01  expires: never       usage: SC
        trust: unknown       validity: unknown
   [ unknown] (1). Qubes Master Signing Key
   
   gpg> fpr
   pub   rsa4096/DDFA1A3E36879494 2010-04-01 Qubes Master Signing Key
    Primary key fingerprint: 427F 11FD 0FAA 4B08 0123  F01C DDFA 1A3E 3687 9494
   ```

3. **Important:** At this point, you still don't know whether the key you just imported is the genuine QMSK or a forgery. In order for this entire procedure to provide meaningful security benefits, you *must* authenticate the QMSK out-of-band. **Do not skip this step!** The standard method is to obtain the QMSK fingerprint from *multiple independent sources in several different ways* and check to see whether they match the key you just imported. For more information, see [How to import and authenticate the Qubes Master Signing Key](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/verifying-signatures.html#how-to-import-and-authenticate-the-qubes-master-signing-key).

   **Tip:** After you have authenticated the QMSK out-of-band to your satisfaction, record the QMSK fingerprint in a safe place (or several) so that you don't have to repeat this step in the future.

4. Once you are satisfied that you have the genuine QMSK, set its trust level to 5 ("ultimate"), then quit GnuPG with `q`.

   ```shell_session
   gpg> trust
   pub  rsa4096/DDFA1A3E36879494
        created: 2010-04-01  expires: never       usage: SC
        trust: unknown       validity: unknown
   [ unknown] (1). Qubes Master Signing Key
   
   Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
   (by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)
   
     1 = I don't know or won't say
     2 = I do NOT trust
     3 = I trust marginally
     4 = I trust fully
     5 = I trust ultimately
     m = back to the main menu
   
   Your decision? 5
   Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y
   
   pub  rsa4096/DDFA1A3E36879494
        created: 2010-04-01  expires: never       usage: SC
        trust: ultimate      validity: unknown
   [ unknown] (1). Qubes Master Signing Key
   Please note that the shown key validity is not necessarily correct
   unless you restart the program.
   
   gpg> q
   ```

5. Use Git to clone the qubes-secpack repo.

   ```shell_session
   $ git clone https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack.git
   Cloning into 'qubes-secpack'...

   Resolving deltas: 100% (1910/1910), done.
   ```

6. Import the included PGP keys. (See our [PGP key policies](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/security-pack.html#pgp-key-policies) for important information about these keys.)

   ```shell_session

   gpg: depth: 1  valid:   6  signed:   0  trust: 6-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 0u
   ```

7. Verify signed Git tags.

   ```shell_session
   $ cd qubes-secpack/
   $ git tag -v `git describe`
   object 266e14a6fae57c9a91362c9ac784d3a891f4d351
   type commit
   tag marmarek_sec_266e14a6
   tagger Marek Marczykowski-Górecki 1677757924 +0100
   
   Tag for commit 266e14a6fae57c9a91362c9ac784d3a891f4d351
   gpg: Signature made Thu 02 Mar 2023 03:52:04 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key 2D1771FE4D767EDC76B089FAD655A4F21830E06A
   gpg: Good signature from "Marek Marczykowski-Górecki (Qubes security pack)" [full]
   ```

   The exact output will differ, but the final line should always start with `gpg: Good signature from...` followed by an appropriate key. The `[full]` indicates full trust, which this key inherits in virtue of being validly signed by the QMSK.

8. Verify PGP signatures, e.g.:

   ```shell_session
   $ cd QSBs/
   $ gpg --verify qsb-087-2022.txt.sig.marmarek qsb-087-2022.txt
   gpg: Signature made Wed 23 Nov 2022 04:05:51 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key 2D1771FE4D767EDC76B089FAD655A4F21830E06A
   gpg: Good signature from "Marek Marczykowski-Górecki (Qubes security pack)" [full]
   $ gpg --verify qsb-087-2022.txt.sig.simon qsb-087-2022.txt
   gpg: Signature made Wed 23 Nov 2022 03:50:42 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key EA18E7F040C41DDAEFE9AA0F4AC18DE1112E1490
   gpg: Good signature from "Simon Gaiser (Qubes Security Pack signing key)" [full]
   $ cd ../canaries/
   $ gpg --verify canary-034-2023.txt.sig.marmarek canary-034-2023.txt
   gpg: Signature made Thu 02 Mar 2023 03:51:48 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key 2D1771FE4D767EDC76B089FAD655A4F21830E06A
   gpg: Good signature from "Marek Marczykowski-Górecki (Qubes security pack)" [full]
   $ gpg --verify canary-034-2023.txt.sig.simon canary-034-2023.txt
   gpg: Signature made Thu 02 Mar 2023 01:47:52 AM PST
   gpg:                using RSA key EA18E7F040C41DDAEFE9AA0F4AC18DE1112E1490
   gpg: Good signature from "Simon Gaiser (Qubes Security Pack signing key)" [full]
   ```

   Again, the exact output will differ, but the final line of output from each `gpg --verify` command should always start with `gpg: Good signature from...` followed by an appropriate key.


For this announcement (QSB-106), the commands are:

```
$ gpg --verify qsb-106-2024.txt.sig.marmarek qsb-106-2024.txt
$ gpg --verify qsb-106-2024.txt.sig.simon qsb-106-2024.txt
```

You can also verify the signatures directly from this announcement in addition to or instead of verifying the files from the qubes-secpack. Simply copy and paste the QSB-106 text into a plain text file and do the same for both signature files. Then, perform the same authentication steps as listed above, substituting the filenames above with the names of the files you just created.
