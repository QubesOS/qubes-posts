Fedora 33 was [released today], 2020-10-27. According to the [Fedora
Release Life Cycle], this means that Fedora 31 is scheduled to reach
EOL ([end-of-life]) in approximately four weeks, around [2020-11-24].

We strongly recommend that all Qubes users upgrade their Fedora 31
TemplateVMs and StandaloneVMs to Fedora 32 or higher before Fedora 31
reaches EOL. We provide step-by-step upgrade instructions for [upgrading
Fedora TemplateVMs]. For a complete list of TemplateVM versions
supported for your specific version of Qubes, see [Supported TemplateVM
Versions].

We also provide a fresh Fedora 32 TemplateVM package through the
official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following
the standard [installation instructions].

After upgrading your TemplateVMs, please remember to [switch all qubes
that were using the old template to use the new one][switching].

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in
dom0. For details, please see our [note on dom0 and EOL].
