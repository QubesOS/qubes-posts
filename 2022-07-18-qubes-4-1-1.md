We're pleased to announce the stable release of Qubes 4.1.1! This release aims to consolidate all the security patches, bug fixes, and upstream template OS upgrades that have occurred since the initial Qubes 4.1.0 release in February. Our goal is to provide a secure and convenient way for users to install (or reinstall) the latest stable Qubes release with an up-to-date ISO.

Qubes 4.1.1 is available on the [downloads](/downloads/) page.


## Reminder: Qubes 4.0 approaching end-of-life

As we recently [announced](/news/2022/07/04/qubes-os-4-0-eol-on-2022-08-04/), Qubes 4.0 reaches EOL (end-of-life) on 2022-08-04. If you're using Qubes 4.0 and have been waiting for an opportunity to upgrade to Qubes 4.1 via the [clean reinstallation](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/downloading-installing-upgrading/upgrade/4_1.html#clean-installation) method, we strongly recommend using this Qubes 4.1.1 release to do so, as this is the last Qubes 4.1 patch release before Qubes 4.0 reaches EOL.


## Existing Qubes 4.1.0 and release candidate users

If you are already using Qubes 4.1.0 or [Qubes 4.1.1-rc1](/news/2022/06/27/qubes-4-1-1-rc1/), then you should simply [update normally](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/how-to-guides/how-to-update.html) (which includes [upgrading any EOL templates](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/how-to-guides/how-to-update.html#upgrading-to-avoid-eol) you might have) in order to make your system essentially equivalent to this stable Qubes 4.1.1 release. No special action is required on your part.


## What's new in Qubes 4.1.1?

Qubes 4.1.1 includes numerous updates over the initial 4.1.0 release, in particular:

- All 4.1.0 dom0 updates to date
- Fedora 36 template (upgraded from Fedora 34)
- Linux kernel 5.15 (upgraded from 5.10)


## What is a patch release?

The Qubes OS Project uses the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standard. Version numbers are written as `[major].[minor].[patch]`. Hence, we refer to releases that increment the third number as "patch releases." A patch release does not designate a separate, new major or minor release of Qubes OS. Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this case, 4.1.0) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing Qubes 4.1.0 and fully updating it results in essentially the same system as installing Qubes 4.1.1. You can learn more about how Qubes release versioning works in the [version scheme](/doc/version-scheme/) documentation.
