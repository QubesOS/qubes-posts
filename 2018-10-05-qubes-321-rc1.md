We're pleased to announce the first release candidate for Qubes 3.2.1!
This is the first and only planned patch release for version 3.2.
Features:

- Fedora 28 TemplateVM
- Debian 9 TemplateVM
- Whonix 14 Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs
- Linux kernel 4.14

Qubes 3.2.1-rc1 is available on the [Downloads] page.


What is a patch release?
------------------------

A patch release does not designate a separate, new major or minor release of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 3.2) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 3.2 and fully updating it results in the same system as installing
Qubes 3.2.1.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you're currently using an up-to-date Qubes 3.2 installation, then
your system is already equivalent to a Qubes 3.2.1 installation. No
action is needed.

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 3.2 for any reason, then the 3.2.1 ISO will make this more
convenient and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 3.2 updates to date.
It will be especially helpful for users whose hardware is too new to be
compatible with the original Qubes 3.2 installer.

As a reminder, Qubes 3.2 (and, therefore, Qubes 3.2.1) is scheduled to
reach EOL (end-of-life) on [2019-03-28].


Release candidate planning
-------------------------

If no major problems are discovered with this release candidate in the
next two weeks, it will be designated the final 3.2.1 release. [Please
report any bugs you find.][reporting-bugs]


What about Qubes 4.0.1?
-----------------------

The Qubes developers are hard at work on 4.0.1, which will be the first
patch release for Qubes 4.0. We hope to have further news about this
within the next few weeks. Stay tuned!
