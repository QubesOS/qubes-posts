Fedora 29 has reached EOL ([end-of-life]). We strongly recommend that
all Qubes users upgrade their Fedora 29 TemplateVMs and StandaloneVMs to
Fedora 30 immediately. We provide step-by-step upgrade instructions for
[upgrading Fedora TemplateVMs]. For a complete list of TemplateVM
versions supported for your specific version of Qubes, see [Supported
TemplateVM Versions].

We also provide a fresh Fedora 30 TemplateVM package through the
official Qubes repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following
the standard [installation instructions].

After upgrading your TemplateVMs, please remember to [switch all qubes
that were using the old template to use the new one][switching].

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in
dom0. For details, please see our [Note on dom0 and EOL].
