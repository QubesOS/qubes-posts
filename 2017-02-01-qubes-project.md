We've just introduced a new mailing list: [qubes-project]

This list is for non-technical discussion and coordination around the Qubes OS project. Examples of topics or question suitable for this list include:

* Participation (talks, workshops, etc.) at upcoming events
* Project funding applications and strategies
* FOSS governance discussions
* Outreach/propaganda materials
* Most GitHub issues tagged “[business][business]”
