Whonix 16 is currently [scheduled](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Qubes_Hosts) to reach EOL (end-of-life) on 2024-01-18. We strongly recommend that all Whonix users upgrade to Whonix 17 before then. For more information, see [Upgrading to avoid EOL](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/how-to-guides/how-to-update.html#upgrading-to-avoid-eol). Please note that Whonix 17 is available only on Qubes OS 4.2.

There are three ways to upgrade to Whonix 17:

- **Recommended:** Perform a [clean installation](/doc/installation-guide/) of [Qubes OS 4.2.0](/news/2023/12/18/qubes-os-4-2-0-has-been-released/), which comes with Whonix 17 templates preinstalled (if selected during installation).

- **Recommended:** [Install fresh Whonix templates to replace the existing ones.](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Install) After you install the new templates, redo all desired template modifications and [switch everything that was set to the old templates to the new templates](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/templates.html#switching).

- **Advanced:** Perform an [in-place upgrade from Whonix 16 to Whonix 17](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Release_Upgrade_16_to_17). This option will preserve any modifications you've made to the templates, **but it may be more complicated for less experienced users.**
