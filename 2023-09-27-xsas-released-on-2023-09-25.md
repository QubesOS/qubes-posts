## About this announcement

Qubes OS uses the [Xen hypervisor](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Project_Software_Overview) as part of its [architecture](/doc/architecture/). When the [Xen Project](https://xenproject.org/) publicly discloses a vulnerability in the Xen hypervisor, they issue a notice called a [Xen security advisory (XSA)](https://xenproject.org/developers/security-policy/). Vulnerabilities in the Xen hypervisor sometimes have security implications for Qubes OS. When they do, we issue a notice called a [Qubes security bulletin (QSB)](/security/qsb/). (QSBs are also issued for non-Xen vulnerabilities.) However, QSBs can provide only *positive* confirmation that certain XSAs *do* affect the security of Qubes OS. QSBs cannot provide *negative* confirmation that other XSAs do *not* affect the security of Qubes OS. Therefore, we also maintain an [XSA tracker](/security/xsa/), which is a comprehensive list of all XSAs publicly disclosed to date, including whether each one affects the security of Qubes OS. When new XSAs are published, we add them to the XSA tracker and publish a notice like this one in order to inform Qubes users that a new batch of XSAs has been released and whether each one affects the security of Qubes OS.
