## Job description
We're seeking a talented developer with a focus on the Linux graphics stack in a virtualized environment, specifically in [Qubes OS](/). Qubes OS is a free and open-source security-oriented operating system that uses the Xen hypervisor to securely compartmentalize the user's applications, data, and devices into isolated virtual machines called "qubes" so that the compromise of any one qube does not affect the rest of the system.

This role presents exciting challenges and the opportunity to work on pioneering solutions that have never been attempted before. As a key member of our team, you will lead the migration of the Qubes OS graphics stack from X11 to Wayland, as well as implement support for rendering hardware acceleration, all while maintaining the robust security properties for which Qubes OS is known.

## Responsibilities
- Lead the migration of the Qubes OS graphics stack from X11 to Wayland
- Implement support for rendering hardware acceleration
- Ensure the strong security properties of Qubes OS are preserved throughout the development process
- Collaborate with team members and contribute to open-source projects

## Requirements
- Strong knowledge of the Linux graphics stack, especially Wayland (familiarity with X11 a plus)
- Basic understanding of kernel drivers and virtualization
- Proficiency in the C programming language
- Previous contributions to an open-source project
- Experience with Git
- Ability to work independently, proactively solve problems, and seek assistance when needed

## Preferred skills
- Rust
- Python
- RPM packaging
- DEB packaging

## What we offer
- Fully remote work with flexible hours
- Long-term contract opportunities
- A collaborative and innovative work environment

## How to apply
If you're passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and want to be part of a groundbreaking project, we would love to hear from you! Please send your CV or résumé to `jobs[at]invisiblethingslab[dot]com`.

Join us in shaping the future of secure computing with Qubes OS!
