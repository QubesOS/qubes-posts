After many years of work, the team is pleased to announce the first
release candidate for Qubes 4.1!

Qubes 4.1 includes several major new features, each of which is
explained in depth in its own article:

- [Qubes Architecture Next Steps: The GUI Domain]
- [Qubes Architecture Next Steps: The New Qrexec Policy System]
- [New Gentoo templates and maintenance infrastructure]
- [Reproducible builds for Debian: a big step forward]

This release candidate also includes numerous other improvements and
bug fixes, which are listed in the [release notes] and in the [issue
tracker].

Finally, Qubes 4.1 features the following updated default components:

- Xen 4.14
- Fedora 32 in dom0
- Fedora 34 template
- Debian 11 template
- Whonix 16 Gateway and Workstation templates
- Linux kernel 5.10

Qubes 4.1-rc1 is available on the [downloads] page.


How to test Qubes 4.1-rc1
-------------------------

If you're willing to [test] this release candidate, you can help to
improve the stable release by [reporting any bugs you encounter].
Experienced users are strongly encouraged to join the [testing team]!

There are two ways to migrate to 4.1-rc1:

- [Back up] your current installation, perform a [fresh install] of 4.1-rc1, then [restore] from your backup.
- Perform an [in-place upgrade].


Release candidate planning
--------------------------

As with any initial release candidate, it's likely that user testing
will reveal important bugs that we'll want to fix before the stable
release. Depending on the severity of the bugs discovered and how long
it takes to fix them, we expect that it may be anywhere from a few weeks
to a few months before we announce the second release candidate.
