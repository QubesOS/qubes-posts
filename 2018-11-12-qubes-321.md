We're pleased to announce the stable release of Qubes 3.2.1! As we [previously
announced][3.2.1-rc1], this is the first and only planned patch release for
version 3.2. Since no major problems were discovered with 3.2.1-rc1, this stable
release is not significantly different from the release candidate. Features:

- Fedora 28 TemplateVM
- Debian 9 TemplateVM
- Whonix 14 Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs
- Linux kernel 4.14

Release 3.2.1 has replaced Release 3.2 on the [Downloads] page.


What is a patch release?
------------------------

A patch release does not designate a separate, new major or minor release of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 3.2) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 3.2 and fully updating it results in the same system as installing
Qubes 3.2.1.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you're currently using an up-to-date Qubes 3.2 installation, then
your system is already equivalent to a Qubes 3.2.1 installation. No
action is needed.

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 3.2 for any reason, then the 3.2.1 ISO will make this more
convenient and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 3.2 updates to date.
It will be especially helpful for users whose hardware is too new to be
compatible with the original Qubes 3.2 installer.

As a reminder, Qubes 3.2 (and, therefore, Qubes 3.2.1) is scheduled to
reach EOL (end-of-life) on [2019-03-28].


What about Qubes 4.0.1?
-----------------------

We recently announced the release of [4.0.1-rc1]. You can help us [test] this
release candidate and [report any bugs you encounter] so that they can be fixed
before the stable release.
