We're pleased to announce the third release candidate for Qubes 4.0! Our
goal for this release candidate is to improve the stability and
reliability of Qubes 4.0, so we've prioritized fixing known bugs over
introducing new features.  Many of the bugs discovered in our [previous
release candidate][rc2-announcement] are now resolved. A full list of
the Qubes 4.0 issues closed so far is available [here][closed-issues].

As always, we're immensely grateful to our community of testers for
taking the time to [discover and report bugs]. Thanks to your efforts,
we're able to fix these bugs *before* the final release of Qubes 4.0. We
encourage you to continue diligently testing this third release
candidate so that we can work together to improve Qubes 4.0 before the
stable release.

Current users of Qubes 4.0-rc2 can upgrade in-place by downloading the
latest updates from the testing repositories in both
[dom0][dom0-testing] and [TemplateVMs][domU-testing].  Further details,
including full installation instructions, are available in the [Qubes
4.0 release notes][release-notes]. The new installation image is
available on the [Downloads] page.
