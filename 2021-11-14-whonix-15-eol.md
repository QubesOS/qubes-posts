Whonix 15 has reached EOL (end-of-life). If you have not already done
so, we strongly recommend upgrading your Whonix 15 templates and
standalones to [Whonix 16] immediately. The Whonix Project provides
fresh Whonix 16 template packages through the Qubes community template
repositories, which you can install in dom0 by following the standard
[installation instructions]. Alternatively, the Whonix Project also
provides step-by-step instructions for [performing an in-place upgrade]
of an existing Whonix 15 template. After upgrading your templates,
please remember to [switch all qubes that were using the old template
to use the new one][switching].

For a complete list of template releases supported for your specific
Qubes release, please see our [supported template releases].
