There will be two separate Qubes presentations at this year's [Platform Security Summit][pss].

[Marek Marczykowski-Górecki]'s presentation in the Hypervisor category is titled, ["Complexity Everywhere: is it time to step back and rethink our platforms?"][pss-marek]

Meanwhile, [Thierry Laurion] of [Insurgo Open Technologies] will give a presentation in the Boot Integrity category titled, ["Accessible Security: deploying Qubes reasonably secured OS on slightly more secured hardware. An OEM approach to transferring device and secrets ownership."][pss-thierry]

We recently announced that [Insurgo's PrivacyBeast X230 passed Qubes 4.0 hardware certification][x230] to become a [Qubes-certified Laptop].

The summit will take place October 1--3 in Redmond, Washington.
