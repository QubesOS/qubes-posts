Qubes OS Donation Update
========================

Thank you to everyone who has [donated][donations] to the Qubes OS Project!
As many of you know, there are two ways to donate: through our [Bitcoin fund]
and through [Open Collective]. Some of you may have noticed that we
haven't spent any of the funds donated through Open Collective yet. This
is because we've been waiting until there are sufficient funds to pay a
developer to work specifically on Qubes tasks. We've now reached that
point! Soon, we'll begin making our first series of payments. We'll be
filing these expenses through Open Collective so that the process is
completely transparent. Meanwhile, we've already begun using some of the
Bitcoin funds to pay developers to work on Qubes, and we'll be increasing
this even more in the near future.

While we're extremely grateful for all the donations we've received,
it's worth noting that they cover just a fraction of what it costs to pay
the Qubes developers each year. If you'd like to start [supporting][donations]
the development of Qubes, or continue to do so, there's no better time than
now!

Thank you,  
The Qubes OS Team
