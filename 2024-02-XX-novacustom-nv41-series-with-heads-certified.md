Last year, we [announced](/news/2023/05/03/novacustom-nv41-series-qubes-certified/) that the [NovaCustom NV41 Series](https://novacustom.com/product/nv41-series/) became a [Qubes-certified computer](/doc/certified-hardware) for Qubes OS 4. We noted in the announcement that the NV41 Series came with [Dasharo](https://www.dasharo.com/) [coreboot](https://www.coreboot.org/) open-source firmware.

We are now pleased to announce that the NV41 Series is also available with [Heads firmware](https://osresearch.net/). When you [configure your NV41 Series](https://novacustom.com/product/nv41-series/), you can now choose either Dasharo coreboot or Heads for the firmware. Both options are certified for Qubes OS 4. This makes the NV41 Series the first modern Qubes-certified computer available with Heads!

Current NV41 Series owners who wish to change from Dasharo coreboot to Heads should [contact NovaCustom](https://novacustom.com/contact/) for assistance.
