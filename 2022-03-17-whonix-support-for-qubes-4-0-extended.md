The Whonix Project has extended its support for Whonix templates on
Qubes 4.0 by an additional month to 2022-04-20. This comes after an
initial 16-day extension when the release of Qubes 4.1 was [originally
announced].

## How does Whonix support work?

While Qubes OS releases are [supported for six months] following each
subsequent major or minor release, Whonix templates have their own
[support policy] set by the Whonix Project. This policy requires Whonix
template users to stay reasonably close to the cutting edge by upgrading
to new stable releases of Qubes OS and Whonix templates within a month
of their respective releases. To be precise:

- One month after a new stable version of Qubes OS is released, Whonix
  templates are no longer supported on any older release of Qubes OS.
  This means that users who wish to continue using Whonix templates on
  Qubes are usually required to upgrade to the latest stable Qubes OS
  version within one month of its release (unless the deadline is
  extended, as it has been in this case).

- One month after new stable versions of Whonix templates are released,
  older releases of Whonix templates are no longer supported. This means
  that users who wish to continue using Whonix templates on Qubes are
  usually required to upgrade to the latest stable Whonix template
  versions within one month of their release. (This point doesn't apply
  to the present situation, since this announcement pertains to a new
  Qubes OS release, not a new Whonix template release. However, I'm
  mentioning it here for the sake of completeness, as it's part of the
  Whonix support policy.)

## What does this mean for you?

If you haven't upgraded from Qubes 4.0 to Qubes 4.1 yet, and you use
Whonix templates, this extension means you have a bit more time to
upgrade before your Whonix templates are no longer supported. You should
aim to upgrade to Qubes 4.1 (or discontinue use of Whonix templates) by
2022-04-20.

If you're already on Qubes 4.1 or you don't use Whonix templates, you're
all set. This announcement doesn't change anything for you.
