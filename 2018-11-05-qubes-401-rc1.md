We're pleased to announce the first release candidate for Qubes 4.0.1!
This is the first of at least two planned point releases for version 4.0.
Features:

- All 4.0 dom0 updates to date
- Fedora 29 TemplateVM
- Debian 9 TemplateVM
- Whonix 14 Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs
- Linux kernel 4.14

Qubes 4.0.1-rc1 is available on the [Downloads] page.


What is a point release?
------------------------

A point release does not designate a separate, new version of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 4.0) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 4.0 and fully updating it results in the same system as installing
Qubes 4.0.1.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you're currently using an up-to-date Qubes 4.0 installation, then
your system is already equivalent to a Qubes 4.0.1 installation. No
action is needed.

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 4.0 for any reason, then the 4.0.1 ISO will make this more
convenient and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 4.0 updates to date.
It will be especially helpful for users whose hardware is too new to be
compatible with the original Qubes 4.0 installer.


Release candidate planning
--------------------------

We expect that there will be a second release candidate (4.0.1-rc2) following
this one (4.0.1-rc1). The second release candidate will include a fix for the
Nautilus bug reported in [#4460] along with any other available fixes for bugs
reported against this release candidate. As usual, you can help by [reporting
any bugs you encounter][reporting-bugs].


What about Qubes 3.2.1?
-----------------------

[We announced the release of 3.2.1-rc1 one month ago][3.2.1]. Since no serious
problems have been discovered in 3.2.1-rc1, we plan to build the final version
of Qubes 3.2.1 at the end of this week.
