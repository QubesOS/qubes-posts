Fedora 32 has reached EOL ([end-of-life]). If you have not already done
so, we strongly recommend [upgrading] your Fedora 32 TemplateVMs and
StandaloneVMs to Fedora 33 immediately. We provide a fresh Fedora 33
TemplateVM package through the official Qubes repositories, which you
can install in dom0 by following the standard [installation
instructions]. Alternatively, we also provide step-by-step instructions
for [performing an in-place upgrade] of an existing Fedora TemplateVM.
After upgrading your TemplateVMs, please remember to [switch all qubes
that were using the old template to use the new one][switching].

For a complete list of TemplateVM versions supported for your specific
version of Qubes, see [Supported TemplateVM Versions].

Please note that no user action is required regarding the OS version in
dom0. For details, please see our [note on dom0 and EOL].
