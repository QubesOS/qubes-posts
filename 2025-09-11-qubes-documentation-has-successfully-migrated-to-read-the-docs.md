The [migration of the Qubes documentation to Read the Docs](/news/2025/07/23/qubes-documentation-migrating-to-read-the-docs/) is now complete! As of today, the new documentation hosted by Read the Docs has officially replaced the old documentation, and all old documentation URLs will automatically redirect to their new counterparts at <https://doc.qubes-os.org> from now on. We're incredibly grateful to the Qubes community for helping us review the new documentation during our 20-day community testing period, especially [parulin](https://github.com/parulin) and [tokideveloper](https://github.com/tokideveloper)!

Thanks to [maiska](https://www.qubes-os.org/team/#m), we now also have an updated guide for [how to edit the documentation](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/developer/general/how-to-edit-the-rst-documentation.html) and a new [reStructuredText documentation style guide](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/developer/general/rst-documentation-style-guide.html)! If you'd like to request any features or improvements to the documentation, or if you'd like to report a bug, please [open an issue](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/introduction/issue-tracking.html). If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know on our [mailing lists or forum](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/introduction/support.html).
